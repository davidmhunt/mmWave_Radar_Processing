#### Conda (Backup)
1. If conda isn't already installed, follow the [Conda Install Instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) to install conda
2. Use the following command to download the conda installation (for linux)
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
3. Run the conda installation script (-b for auto accepting the license)
```
bash Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
```
3. Once conda is installed, create a new conda environment with the correct version of python
```
conda create -n mmWaveRadarProcessing python=3.10
```

### 2. Clone mmWave_Radar_Processing
```
git clone https://github.com/davidmhunt/mmWave_Radar_Processing.git
```

### 3. Install mmWave_Radar_Processing using Poetry

#### Installing Poetry:
 
1. Check to see if Python Poetry is installed. If the below command is successful, poetry is installed move on to setting up the conda environment

```
    poetry --version
```
2. If Python Poetry is not installed, follow the [Poetry Install Instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer). On linux, Poetry can be installed using the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

#### Installing mmWave_Radar_Processing
Navigate to the mmWave_Radar_Processing foler (this folder) and execute the following command

```
poetry install --with submodules
```

If you get an an error saying: "Failed to unlock the collection!", execute the following command in the terminal:
```
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```

#### Updating mmWave_Radar_Processing
If the pyproject.toml file is updated, the poetry installation must also be updated. Use the following commands to update the version of poetry
```
poetry lock --no-update
poetry install
```

### Using .env for Project Directories

In order to use any datasets in your computer's directory, you must first create a .env file and mark where the dataset files can be found.

1. Create a .env file in your project's root directory. This will file will not be uploaded to GitHub when you commit your changes.
2. Inside the .env file, add these variables
```
DATASET_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
MAP_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
MOVIE_TEMP_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
```
3. Replace the example text with the path to your directory
